              <p>
                Cheruvathur is a cosy small town in the Kasaragod district of Kerala, located only 10 kilometres south of the major town of Nileshwaram. The place is known for being the birthplace of great 19th-century poet Mahakavi Kuttamath of Kerala. His work on musical drama and poem compilations is an excellent source of literary inspiration in Cheruvathur. Keeping that in mind, authorities changed the name of the town to Kuttamath Nagar on paper. However, most people still call the town Cheruvathur only.
