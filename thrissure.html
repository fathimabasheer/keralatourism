                <p>
                    Located 60 km from the Thrissur district of Kerala, Athirapally Falls is a marvellous cascade of frothy waters that makes its way from the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats. Also called as Bahubali Waterfall, this 80 ft high and 330 ft wide marvel is the largest waterfall in Kerala. It is often referred to as the "Niagara Falls of India". From here, the Athirapally falls flows through the verdant greenery of Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea, creating a spectacular vista of scintillating water, emerald jungles and azure sky.

When you land in Athirapally, you are greeted with the sight of charming green Sholayar Peaks peering over the rushing gush of the falls. Standing against the backdrop of a rustling jungle foliage, this many films and music videos are shot here.

Another interesting fact to note is that the fall joins forces with the Chalakkudy river before reaching its final destination into the sea.
